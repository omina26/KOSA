# KOSA

Our project would provide Spotify users with a personalized listening experience relating to a list of factors specified 
by the user. 

Users can enter their mood or current action/focus, and the program will generate a playlist based on audio features 
suitable for the input and also take into account the user's top tracks. The user can also set a daily schedule, and 
playlists will be generated based on that schedule (e.g. high energy music for gym or instrumental music for study). 
Additionally, the program should be able to generate a playlist tailored to the userâ€™s typically listened to music 
based on genre and general features of the music specified by the user. The program should also be able to combine 
top tracks for multiple users and create playlists based on commonalities in the tracks along with a target mood.
